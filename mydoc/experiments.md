## Terminology

- Experiment : A method of modifying systemâ€™s behaviour based on context.
- Feature Toggle / Feature Flag is a stateless experiment.
- A/B test is a stateful experiment where we keep track of the participants.

Multiple experiments can be created with the same key - for example running 2 experiments of the same type:

- One experiment on 50% of users in Japan & one experiment on 20% of users in USA
- One FT for all company employees & one A/B test for the rest of the world

At Wix, we created a Backoffice application for creating and editing experiments. Learn how to setup yours [here]({{site.data.urls.creating_a_petri_backoffice_app.url}})

# Experiment specs

## What are experiment specs?
An experiment spec is a template for creating experiments. It defines the experiment key, test groups (possible outcomes/results), product(s) the experiment belongs to, and an owner.

It is easiest to explain with a sample:

1. define the spec:

```
    public class ButtonColorSpec extends SpecDefinition {

    @Override
    protected ExperimentSpecBuilder customize(ExperimentSpecBuilder builder) {
        return builder.
               withTestGroups(asList("yellow", "blue")).
               withScopes(aScopeDefinitionForAllUserTypes("ourProduct"));
    }
```

2. Create an experiment using the spec definition:

```
    DateTime now = new DateTime();
    petriClient.insertExperiment(
           anExperimentSnapshot().
                   withKey(spec.class.getName()).
                   withGroups(<list built based on values of spec.getTestGroups()>)
           build());
```

3. Use Laboratory's safe conduct API:

```
    return laboratory.conductExperiment(ButtonColorSpec.class, "yellow");
```


## Deciding whether to use experiment specs

The above could also be achieved by the following steps:

1. Create an experiment without using a spec:

```
    DateTime now = new DateTime();
    petriClient.insertExperiment(
           anExperimentSnapshot().
                   withKey("ButtonColorSpec").
                   withGroups(<list of test groups>)
           build());
```

2. Use Laboratory's free text conduct API:

``` 
    return laboratory.conductExperiment("ButtonColorSpec"", "yellow");
```

### The benefits of using specs

- Using **specs eliminates the possibility of typos**

  - There cannot be a mismatch between the key used to create an experiment and the key used when conducting it.
  - There can also be no mismatch between testgroup values used to create an experiment and the testgroup values the code refers to.

> Our best practice is to allow creating experiments based on existing specs, except for specific use cases where free text keys and/or values are absolutely necessary. This best practice emerged as a lesson learned from cases of hunting down experiments that did not seem to be working. 

- **Using specs enforces a good process**. A product manager and a developer have to sit together and define what makes sense for this experiment at the earliest possible stage of developing the feature.

- **Specs help define the [correct scope of the experiment](https://github.com/wix/petri/wiki/Registered-vs.-Non-Registered-Users)** which is very important for correctness. 



## How to manage experiment specs

The simplest way is to wire the SpecsSynchronizerServlet into your app (as [in the sample app](https://github.com/wix/petri/blob/master/sample-petri-app/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml))

Issuing a POST call to this endpoint ([example](https://github.com/wix/petri/blob/2f63046f3204e9e116b867057ea99bd4d4da2d33/e2e-tests/src/test/java/com/wixpress/common/petri/e2e/PetriE2eTest.java#L100)) will trigger a scan of all specs in your code. 
It is up to you to consider what triggers spec scanning (probably deployment of a new server version).

The deafult package for scanning specs is 'specs'm and can be overriden by setting the 'petri.specs.pkg' property in the laboratory.properties config file.

You could also call the ExperimentSpecBuilder yourself:

```
    petriClient.addSpecs(asList(
                aNewlyGeneratedExperimentSpec(specKey).
                        withTestGroups(testGroupValues).
                build())
```

## Creating experiments without specs

By default, the ExperimentSnapshotBuilder creates an experiment that must have a matching spec.

Creating an experiment without a matching spec will result in an error from Petri Server.

If you want to override this you must call the ```withFromSpec(false)``` on the builder.
