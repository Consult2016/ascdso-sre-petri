Petri
=====

Wix's holistic experiment system that covers the lifecycle of product experimenting (A/B tests and feature toggles).

Petri is used at large scale at [Wix](www.wix.com), supporting dozens of daily changes (instantly affecting production), affecting the experience users receive and enabling our product to know what really works, or affecting the inner implementation of our services and enabling our devs to gradually roll out features.  
Petri allows you to define filters that determine what users will be included in the experiment (by language, geo, user-agent, for individual users and more).
