Petri
=====

Wix's holistic experiment system - covers the lifecycle of product experimenting (A/B tests and feature toggles).

Petri is used at large scale at [Wix](http://www.wix.com), supporting dozens of daily changes (instantly affecting production).  

A/B tests can be used to affect the experience users receive, thus enabling our product to know what our users prefer.
Feature toggles can be used to control inner implementation details, thus enabling our devs to gradually roll out features and sleep well at nights.  

Petri allows you to define filters that determine what users will be included in the experiment (by language, geo, user-agent, for individual users and more).
